# Updates Summary - Learning Diagnostic App

## Date: October 4, 2025

### Issues Fixed

This document summarizes all the changes made to address the issues identified in the user's feedback.

---

## 1. ✅ YouTube Video Links Fixed

**Issue**: Video links were using invalid YouTube URLs (e.g., `watch?v=priming_basics`)

**Solution**: Updated all video URLs in `data/videos.json` to use YouTube search query format:
- Changed from: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=priming_basics`
- Changed to: `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=priming+learning+technique+activation`

**Files Modified**:
- `/data/videos.json`

**Result**: Video links now lead to YouTube search results for relevant topics instead of non-existent videos.

---

## 2. ✅ Canvas/Chart Visibility Fixed

**Issue**: Chart labels and content were being cut off, especially on the radar chart

**Solution**: 
- Increased canvas size from 300x300 to 500x500 pixels
- Adjusted radar chart margins from 20px to 60px to accommodate labels
- Improved label positioning with better spacing (35px offset instead of 10px)
- Fixed radar chart rotation to start from top (-Math.PI/2)
- Added better text alignment logic for labels

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/utils/chart.utils.ts`
- `/src/utils/chart.utils.js`
- `/src/views/app.views.ts`
- `/src/views/app.views.js`

**Result**: All chart elements are now fully visible with proper spacing.

---

## 3. ✅ Report Design Improvements

**Issue**: Report design didn't match the professional look shown in reference screenshots

**Solution**:
- **Donut Chart Enhancements**:
  - Added overall score display in the center of the donut chart (large bold percentage)
  - Moved domain labels outside the chart with separate percentage displays
  - Improved color scheme and typography
  - Removed redundant "Overall Score" heading (now shown in chart)

- **Chart Container Styling**:
  - Increased max-width from 500px to 600px
  - Added subtle box shadows and rounded corners to charts
  - Improved spacing between charts (3rem gap)
  - Added padding and background to canvas elements

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/utils/chart.utils.ts`
- `/src/utils/chart.utils.js`
- `/src/views/app.views.ts`
- `/src/views/app.views.js`
- `/public/styles.css`

**Result**: Report now has a cleaner, more professional appearance matching the reference design.

---

## 4. ✅ Local History Storage

**Issue**: No way to track progress over time

**Solution**: Created comprehensive history service with:
- Automatic saving of quiz results to localStorage
- Timestamp and formatted date for each entry
- Maximum of 50 entries stored (auto-pruned)
- Structured history entries with full diagnostic results

**Files Created**:
- `/src/services/history.service.ts`
- `/src/services/history.service.js` (auto-generated)

**Features**:
- `getHistory()` - Retrieve all history entries
- `getLatestEntry()` - Get most recent entry
- `saveToHistory()` - Save new results
- `deleteEntry()` - Remove specific entry
- `clearHistory()` - Clear all history

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/app.ts` - Integrated history saving on results computation

**Result**: Every quiz attempt is automatically saved with timestamp.

---

## 5. ✅ Import/Export History Functionality

**Issue**: No way to backup or transfer quiz history

**Solution**: Added import/export capabilities:

**Export History**:
- Exports all history entries as formatted JSON file
- Filename includes timestamp: `youcanstudy-history-[timestamp].json`
- Preserves all quiz data, scores, flags, and recommendations

**Import History**:
- File picker dialog for JSON import
- Validates imported data structure
- Merges with existing history (avoiding duplicates)
- Maintains chronological order
- Limits to 50 most recent entries

**UI Additions**:
- "Export History" button in results view
- "Import History" button in results view
- Both buttons appear alongside existing export options

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/services/history.service.ts` - Added `exportHistory()` and `importHistory()` functions
- `/src/app.ts` - Added handler methods
- `/src/views/app.views.ts` - Added history buttons to UI

**Result**: Users can now backup and restore their quiz history across devices.

---

## 6. ✅ Previous Response Display

**Issue**: When retaking quiz, no reference to previous answers

**Solution**: Implemented previous answer display:
- Retrieves last quiz attempt from history
- Shows previous answer in italicized purple text below question
- Format: "Last time: [answer]"
- For Likert scale: Shows text label (Never/Rarely/Sometimes/Often/Always)
- For Yes/No/Maybe: Shows the chosen option
- Only displays if previous attempt exists

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/app.ts` - Gets previous answer and passes to view
- `/src/views/app.views.ts` - Renders previous answer hint
- `/src/views/app.views.js` - Same for JS version

**Result**: Users can see and compare their previous responses while retaking the quiz.

## Technical Details

### New Dependencies
None - used existing browser APIs (localStorage, FileReader, Blob)

### Browser Compatibility
- localStorage: Supported in all modern browsers
- FileReader API: Widely supported
- Blob/URL.createObjectURL: Standard across browsers

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface HistoryEntry {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  timestamp: number;       // Unix timestamp
  date: string;            // Formatted date string
  results: DiagnosticResults;  // Full quiz results
}
```

### Storage Limits
- Maximum 50 history entries
- Automatic pruning of oldest entries
- Each entry ~5-10KB (depends on responses)
- Total storage: ~250-500KB maximum

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Video Links**: Click on recommended videos to verify search results appear
2. **Chart Display**: Complete quiz and verify all labels are visible on both charts
3. **History Saving**: Complete quiz multiple times and check localStorage
4. **Export/Import**: Export history, clear it, then reimport to verify
5. **Previous Answers**: Take quiz twice to see previous response hints
6. **Mobile Display**: Check chart visibility on smaller screens

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential future improvements:
- History viewer page showing all past attempts
- Visual progress charts comparing scores over time
- Delete individual history entries from UI
- Search/filter history entries
- Comparison view between two specific attempts
- Export individual quiz result vs entire history
